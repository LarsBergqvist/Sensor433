# Sensor433
An Arduino Library for sending and receiving values between Arduino boards with simple 433MHz transmitters and receivers
A typical use case is to let small battery powered Arduino Pro Mini boards send sensor values to one single ESP8266 board that creates MQTT messages on the WiFi network from the values.
<p>See the included examples for transmitting, receiving and bridging to MQTT messages.
<p>This library depends on the rc-switch library: https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch
